# 🧠 Stroke Risk Prediction

This project predicts **stroke risk** using machine learning models based on 10,000+ patient records.

## 📊 Dataset
- Full Dataset: [Kaggle Stroke Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)
- This repo includes a **sample dataset (2,000 rows)** for quick testing.

## ⚙️ Features
- Preprocessing: Missing values, Encoding, Normalization
- Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree
- Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix
